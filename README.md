[Live Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwcHG7z2zgY)

## Description
This program is designed to be used as a customer application for renting vehicles.  
It is a console based program, coded using Java programming language, and created in Eclipse IDE.  
It also uses Microsoft SQL Server to script a corresponding database.  
The database, dbVehicleRental has a  table, TLocations to store the car rental pickup locations.  
All processing will take place in the Java program itself.

## How To Use the Application
__Step 1:__ Run the program from class CVehicleFinal (this contains the main method).

## Conclusion  
This application was created as a final project for my Java 1 Programming course in college.  
It is designed as an object-oriented program that uses different classes to run the program in the main method.    
On top of what can be seen in the screenshots, each piece of required input for the customer is validated.
